  GLITCH WHEN CLOSING TWDIALOG

problem: The screen isn't correctly updated when the user close a twDialog.
reason: twRect::operator && was badly coded.
solution: fix twRect::operator &&.


  CRASH WITH XTBSEARCHBAR

problem: XTBTextFieldTest crashes when the user close it.
reason: After m_button's desturctor was called, m_searchBar's once is called.
        And then it calls invokeDelayed for XTBTextField::selectAll(), but 
		m_searchBar is deleted soon, and the text field too.
		In the next event loop, twSDLEvent finally doesn't execute 
		the invocation, but deletes it usually. The invocation is already 
		invalidated, so its destructor shouldn't have called 
		detatchFromInvocation of its target class.
solution: in ~twInvocation(), call detatchFromInvocation only when 
		  m_valid == true.


  BLACKOUT WHEN RESIZING
  
problem: sometimes the screen black-outs when resizing.
reason: unknown.
solution: validate twice.


  CRASH WITH -march=armv4, -mthumb, AND SO ON

problem: crash when it was compiled with -march=..., -mthumb, and so on.
		 it shows: *buffer overflow detected*
reason: -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
solution: -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0


  CANNOT GO BACK

problem: cannot go either back or forward.
reason: displayURL always returned false because of gcc's bug.
solution: -O3 -> -Os
