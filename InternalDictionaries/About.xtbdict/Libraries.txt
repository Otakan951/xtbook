<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Small JPEG Decoder Library v0.93b (jpgdlib)</dt>
<dd><strong>http://www.voicenet.com/~richgel</strong></dd>
<dd>This C++ library decodes JPEG images.  It's not the most full-featured JPEG library available, but it's relatively fast, completely free (LGPL license), uses little memory, and should be easy to understand and further optimize (mostly because it's so small:  the entire library is only a few thousand lines long).  The very common Huffman DCT-based sequential and progressive modes of operation are supported.</dd>
